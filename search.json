I have signed the PRO initiative.\nCitation metrics: I oppose the use of citation metrics for research assessment and have signed the San Francisco Declaration of Research Assessment.\nOpen Reviews: Since spring 2024 I have been posting my reviews online. I advocate for truly open peer review, that is, openly linking research objects with reviews regardless of journals' decisions to publish or not to publish said objects. If you wish to have a manuscript reviewed by me, I encourage you to post it as a pre- print. I also use pubpeer.com for post-publication peer review."

I encourage young scientists to conduct replication studies and warn them that depending on their field, other researchers may not recognize the value of these studies.\nI have been writing a German book on Open Science and how the sciences are becoming more and more open. You can read it for free here."
