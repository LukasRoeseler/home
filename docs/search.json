Most of my running and completed projects can be accessed via my OSF profile.\nBig Team Science: I have been participating in large-scale collaborations that further open science (e.g., Multi100, SCORE) and I am a member of the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT).\nTransparency: Most of my research articles include the 21 word solution, all of them have Open Data, Code, and have been published openly as pre-prints. I signed the Commitment to Research Transparency in 2021 (http://www.researchtransparency.org/signatories/) and encourage you to do so, too! I also publish rejected research proposals for which I have been the first author (example, example)."

I have signed the PRO initiative.\nCitation metrics: I oppose the use of citation metrics for research assessment and have signed the San Francisco Declaration of Research Assessment.\nOpen Reviews: Since spring 2024 I have been posting my reviews online. I advocate for truly open peer review, that is, openly linking research objects with reviews regardless of journals’ decisions to publish or not to publish said objects. If you wish to have a manuscript reviewed by me, I encourage you to post it as a pre- print. I also use pubpeer.com for post-publication peer review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors\n\n\n\nConducting research is a complex endeavour. Thereby, errors happen and can only be corrected if there is a way to point them out. If you find errors or things worth pointing out, I invite you to comment on my research publicly via PubPeer. Moreover, I am open to criticism and suggestions surrounding my research, talks, workshops, and other interactions surrounding science. You can give me anonymous feedback via this Google form."

I encourage young scientists to conduct replication studies and warn them that depending on their field, other researchers may not recognize the value of these studies.\nI have been writing a German book on Open Science and how the sciences are becoming more and more open.
