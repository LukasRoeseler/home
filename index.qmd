### About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Münster, Germany and the managing director of the [Münster Center for Open Science](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MueCOS/en/index.html). I see myself as a strong proponent for Open Science and [Open Scholarship](https://forrt.org/glossary/english/open_scholarship/).

### Mission

My goal is to improve the accessibility and quality of research. I am standing up for repetitive research (e.g., reproductions, replications) to be routinely conducted and to be acknowledged as an integral part of a healthy science. Therefore, together with a large team of researchers, I am actively working on the [FORRT Replication Hub](https://forrt.org/replication-hub).

In August 2024, I made the first version of my German WIP book on Open Science public. I made it available online for free, because not doing so would contradict the very purpose of Open Scholarship: [lukasroeseler.github.io/opensciencebuch/](lukasroeseler.github.io/opensciencebuch/)
